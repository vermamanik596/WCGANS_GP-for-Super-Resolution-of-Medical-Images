# WCGANS_GP for Super-Resolution of Medical Images

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WCGANS_GP) for medical image super-resolution, specifically optimized for chest X-ray images. The model transforms low-resolution medical images (64x64) into high-quality high-resolution (256x256) outputs while preserving critical diagnostic features essential for clinical interpretation.

Our approach combines the training stability of Wasserstein GANs with the enhanced feature preservation capabilities of self-attention mechanisms and spectral normalization, resulting in state-of-the-art performance for medical image enhancement.

## Key Features

- **Wasserstein Loss with Gradient Penalty**: Provides stable training dynamics and prevents mode collapse
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Captures long-range dependencies in medical images to preserve global anatomical context
- **Spectral Normalization**: Ensures Lipschitz continuity in the discriminator for robust adversarial learning
- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: Preserves both global structures and local details crucial for diagnostic accuracy
- **Perceptual Loss**: Uses pre-trained VGG19 network to maintain perceptual quality and diagnostic features

## Architecture Details

### Generator Network

The generator transforms low-resolution images (64×64×3) to high-resolution outputs (256×256×3) through:

1. **Initial Convolutional Layer**: 64 filters with 9×9 kernel size
2. **Residual Blocks**: 16 residual blocks with skip connections to maintain feature propagation
3. **Self-Attention Layer**: Captures spatial dependencies across the entire image
4. **Upsampling Blocks**: Two upsampling blocks with L2 regularization to enhance resolution by 4×
5. **Output Layer**: Tanh activation to produce the final super-resolved image in [-1,1] range

### Discriminator Network

The discriminator evaluates the authenticity of generated images through:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: 8 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (64→512)
2. **Spectral Normalization**: Applied to each layer to enforce Lipschitz constraint
3. **LeakyReLU Activation**: Used with α=0.2 to prevent vanishing gradients
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully-connected layers leading to the final score prediction
5. **Linear Output**: Provides Wasserstein distance estimation without sigmoid activation

### Feature Extractor (VGG19)

A pre-trained VGG19 network serves as a feature extractor for perceptual loss calculation:

1. **Frozen Weights**: Pre-trained on ImageNet with frozen layers
2. **Feature Maps**: Extracts intermediate features for perceptual similarity assessment
3. **Content Loss**: Compares VGG features between generated and real high-resolution images

## Dataset

The model was trained on the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, containing:
- 5,216 chest X-ray images (both normal and pneumonia cases)
- Resized to 256×256 for high-resolution and 64×64 for low-resolution inputs
- Normalized to the range [-1, 1]

## Training Methodology

Training incorporates several advanced techniques:

1. **Wasserstein Loss**: Measures Earth Mover's distance between real and generated distributions
2. **Gradient Penalty**: 10× penalty on gradient norm deviation from 1 for Lipschitz enforcement
3. **Adversarial Loss**: Encourages generator to produce realistic high-resolution images
4. **Perceptual Loss**: Ensures feature-level similarity using VGG19 activations
5. **Adam Optimizer**: Learning rate of 0.0002 and betas of (0.5, 0.9)
6. **Critic Iterations**: Discriminator trained 7× more frequently than generator for stability

Training progress was monitored through:
- Discriminator and generator loss curves
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) metrics
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) metrics
- Visual assessment of generated samples


## Results

Visual results demonstrate significant improvement in image quality and detail preservation across training epochs, with early epochs (21-121) showing initial texture formation, mid-range epochs (221-421) developing clear anatomical structures, and later epochs (521-921) refining fine details and contrast.

Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for medical image super-resolution:

- Peak PSNR: 30.19 dB
- Maximum SSIM: 0.793
- Realistic preservation of clinically important features

## Model Performance Analysis

The training logs demonstrate steady improvement in both quantitative metrics and visual quality:

- **Early Phase (1-200 epochs)**: Rapid PSNR improvement from ~6dB to ~12dB
